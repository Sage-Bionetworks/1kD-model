## 1kD Data Model

This is a data model started by the Data Modeling Group at Sage Bionetworks. 
We maintain the model in the [LinkMl](https://linkml.io/linkml/index.html) YAML format, which for interop can be easily serialized to a number of other formats (e.g. `ttl` or `jsonld`) using LinkML's [generators](https://linkml.io/linkml/generators/index.html).
